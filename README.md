# How it works
- Openfire shares same MySQL DB with WordPress and uses the DB Auth, User and Group providersto share same data.
- Requres PHP to be installed and configured for Jetty FastCGIProxyServlet as normally done for an external web server like Nginx.
- Openfire hosts pre-configured WordPress web application in Jetty instead of Apache or Nginx.
