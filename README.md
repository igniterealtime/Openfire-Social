# Openfire Social
Provides social network with member profiles, activity streams, user groups, messaging, blogs and more by integrating Openfire Meetings with  WordPress, bbPress and BuddyPress.

# How it works
- Openfire shares same MySQL DB with WordPress and uses the DB Auth, User and Group providersto share same data.
- Requres PHP to be installed and configured for Jetty FastCGIProxyServlet as normally done for an external web server like Nginx.
- Openfire hosts pre-configured WordPress web application in Jetty instead of Apache or Nginx.
